Hi there!

Well done... you found your workstation... finally.

I don't know your name. So i simply call you... let me think... err I mean process... h4x0r4000.
Yeah h4x0r4000 is a good name.

We hired you to help us manage our server infrasturcture. There are applications to start, servers to configure and attacs to prevent.

If you come from the shiny and fancy world full of graphics out there you might think "What the heck ist this?".
There are only characters in this thing!! _Calm down_. This "thing" is called a console.
We simply write text in here to tell our machine what to do. If you know what you do this is even faster than moving your mouse and clicking on something to perform a task.

This sounds all really serious but don't be afraid. It's still a game. So maybe you can sacrifice 
some of your valuable time and check out the **credits**.

To start enter **connect** into the textfield below and hit enter.

A list of servers you can connect to will be shown.
You have to choose one by entering the servers name in the textfield.

So have fun and do a great job :)
