Hi there!

Well done... you found your workstation... finally.

I don't know your name. So i simply call you... let me think... err I mean process... h4x0r4000.
Yeah h4x0r4000 is a good name.

You job is to manage our server infrasturcture. There are applications to start... attacks to prevent
and much more.

As this is a game there are credits. Maybe you can sacrifice some of your valuable time and check out
the **credits**. As you are playing this game I'm pretty sure you have some time for this.
